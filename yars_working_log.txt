YARS Working State Log - Successfully Fixed Build Issues
=======================================================

Date: 2025-01-22
Commit: ae05023
Status: ✅ WORKING - All issues resolved

Test Command: ./bin/yars --iterations 1000 xml/braitenberg_logging.xml
Result: SUCCESS - Simulation completed 1000 iterations without errors

Key Fixes Applied:
------------------
1. CMake version requirement updated from 3.0 to 3.5 and moved before project()
2. Removed all boost_system references (header-only in modern Boost 1.89.0)
3. Updated all CMakeLists.txt files to use ${Boost_LIBRARIES} variable
4. Added BULLET_ROOT=/opt/homebrew/opt/bullet for proper Bullet physics detection
5. Fixed Bullet include directories to use ${BULLET_INCLUDE_DIRS}
6. Consolidated boost linking across all YARS modules

Modified Files:
---------------
- CMakeLists.txt: Updated cmake version and moved before project()
- cmake/IncludePackages.cmake: Fixed Boost and Bullet configuration
- contrib/controller/CMakeLists.txt: Replaced all boost_system with ${Boost_LIBRARIES}
- src/yars/CMakeLists.txt: Consolidated boost linking
- src/yars/configuration/CMakeLists.txt: Fixed boost linking
- src/yars/util/CMakeLists.txt: Updated boost linking

Build Output:
-------------
- ✅ All 100% compilation successful
- ✅ All controller libraries built without boost_system errors
- ✅ Main yars executable built successfully
- ✅ All static libraries built successfully

Runtime Test Results:
---------------------
- ✅ Braitenberg vehicle simulation runs successfully
- ✅ Physics simulation completes 1000 iterations
- ✅ Robot movement and velocity logging working correctly
- ✅ No hanging or errors during execution
- ✅ Proper sensor data output showing robot movement

Sample Output Snippet:
----------------------
added wheel left hinge is active: 1
added wheel right hinge is active: 1
main body velocity 0 external | main body velocity 1 external | main body velocity 2 external
0.000 0.000 0.200
-0.000 -0.000 0.160
...
0.227 -0.000 -0.000
Maximum number of physics iterations (1000) reached.

Environment:
------------
- Platform: Darwin 24.6.0 (Apple M4)
- CMake: 3.x
- Boost: 1.89.0 (via Homebrew)
- Bullet: 3.x (via Homebrew at /opt/homebrew/opt/bullet)
- Compiler: AppleClang 17.0.0.17000013

Notes:
------
This state represents a fully working YARS build with all linking issues resolved.
The simulation runs without any errors or hanging, completing the full 1000 iterations.
All controller libraries build successfully, and the Braitenberg vehicle behavior 
demonstrates proper physics simulation and sensor integration.
